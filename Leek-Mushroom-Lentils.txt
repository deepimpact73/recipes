Ingredients

    1 cup lentils, soaked overnight
    2 cups crimini mushrooms, sliced
    2 large leeks, sliced into 1/2 inch rings
    2 tablespoons fresh thyme
    1 tablespoon butter
    1/4 cup olive oil
    salt & pepper

Preparation

    Drain lentils and simmer in about 2 cups of water for 30 minutes, removing from the heat once they have reached the tenderness you like.
    Strain and set aside.
    Heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and saute leeks for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned and somewhat crispy, then set aside.
    Meanwhile, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil and butter in another saucepan and saute mushrooms until softened, about 15 minutes.
    When all ingredients have cooled, stir together with thyme, remaining olive oil and salt & pepper.
